Task:
Using react, redux and recompose create a simple structure of:
- Button that opens a modal, that can be closed on some ‘close’ button inside.
- Inside a modal there’s a simple to-do list: input, button, list itself.
- Items in a list should be clickable and should be removed on click (each individually).
